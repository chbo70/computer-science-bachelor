{-
div  = (/) : divides left to right | div1 :: a -> a-> a
div2 = (2 /) : divides something from 2 | div2 :: a -> a
div3 = (/ 2) : divides something with 2 | div3 :: a -> a
eqTuple f = (\(x, y) -> f x == f y) := compares f(x) and f(y) if they are equal, with a lambda abstraction
    eqTuple :: (a,a) -> Bool
eqTuple' f (x, y) = f x == f y := same as above just with variables
    eqTuple' :: (a,a) -> Bool

difference between div 2 and div3:
    div2 = (2/4) = 0.5
    div3 = (4/2) = 2.0

eqTuple and eqTuple' are the same, since eqTuple is another method with the same solution

foo2 is equal to div1 , since foo1 divides the sscond argument by the first
