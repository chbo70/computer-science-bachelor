**Help**

If you dont know how to use a command simply type: "man <command>" this will show you the options as well as a description to the command. An alternative is to add a help flag(--help).
For more information than the man page use: "info" and to search in a man page use: "apropos".

**man intro**

All commands have status value on termination. In order to test the value type $?, it will return 0 for a successful termination. Everything other than zero is a unsuccessful command.
Linux is a flavor of UNIX, which means every command on UNIX works the same in Linux and other UNIX-like systems. The traditional UNIX is a CLI(command line interface), however there are GUI's(graphical user interface), where you can click and drag.

**man man-pages**

This man page documents the user-space API.
  man <section> <command title>

Here are the available sections:
  * 1 Commands (programs)
  * 2 System calls
  * 3 Library calls
  * 4 Special files (devices)
  * 5 File formats and conventions
  * 6 Games
  * 7 Overview, conventions and miscellaneous
  * 8 System management commands

**man file-hierarchy**

The systemd(1) system and service manager are organized based on a file system inspired by UNIX. To read more about it type: hier(7).

General Structure:
  /     : file system root
  /boot : boot partition or on efi systems the EFI System Partition
  /etc  : this directory holds system specific configurations, can be read only; e.g. systemd,network manager, sound system, ...
  /home : the directory for normal user's home, it is never read only and can be shared with other systems. You can refer to it by typing: $HOME
  /root : is the home directory of the root user, it is outside of /home to make sure that the root user can log in even without /home beeing available
  /srv  : directory to store general server payload
  /tmp  : the directory for smaller temporary files

There are way more subdirectories, such as /usr/bin; /run; /dev ...

**difference between "man printf" and "man 3 printf"**
man 3 printf : this calls the C libraray specific function and displays the manual
man printf : displays the manual for the command printf and is more a overview

**copy files from ZID-GPL**

scp -r csaz9837@zid-gpl.uibk.ac.at:/path/exec01_csaz9837.zip ~/path on local system/
