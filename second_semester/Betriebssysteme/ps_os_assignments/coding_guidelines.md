# Coding Guidelines

All programming exercises are conducted in C.

Your code should always compile without warnings, when passing the flags `-Wall -Wextra -std=c11`.

Make sure your code is properly formatted using either your IDE/Text editor of choice, or by using a tool such as clang-format.
You can find an example [`.clang-format`](.clang-format) file in this repository.
Failure to consistently format code may result in lower scores.

Make sure to choose descriptive variable and function names.
**All names and comments must be written in English.**
