Output:
10,0 °C
-253,1 °C
simply setting celsius.degree = 20; wont work it messes up the output
Use private for degree;

Both Celsius and KelvinThermometer classes do nothing.
We see that it tried to change the celsius by changing the field of Thermometer, however this is not good and
shouldn't be done.

To change the Celsius we need to call the setter, also it is implemented but never used.
The class Thermometer is abstract, which means it wants to hide the implementation...

We use an abstract class, however in the wrong way. Either we do not use an abstract class or we simply make different
subclasses which contain the implementation.
Just like the printMethod implementation.
