c) Investigate and explain:
(i)
Why is it possible to declare two methods with the same name?
(ii)
Is it possible to define two methods with the same name and arguments but different
return values?
(iii)
Remember: Java only supports call by value. Observe the variables passed to each of
the timesTwo methods before and after the method call in the main-method. Did the
values change? Explain why!

Answers:
(i)
java can determinate which arguments are passed to the method,
it checks the type and calls the right method. (overloading)
(ii)
No, because to overload we need the signature of a method, which are: name of method and the passed parameters
(iii)
No, because java creates a copy of the actual value for the method,
which means the value in the main won't change.
