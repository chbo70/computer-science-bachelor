Important: if an object of  a child class is created, then the method in the child classes is called.
Since the method in the "parent" gets overridden by the method in the child class.

Top o1 = new Middle();
Middle o2 = new Bottom();

o1.m(o1) = 4
    A new object of the "child" class Middle is created and the parameter is of Type Top, which means the method
    with parameter (Top) in the Top class gets overridden. Therefore, 4 will be printed

o1.m(o2) = 2
    Same as before, however this time the parameter is of type Middle. Since there is no new method in the class Middle
    the method in the Top Class gets called and 2 gets printed.

o2.m(o1) = 4
    This time a new Object of the "child" class Bottom is created, we can assume that the class Middle is now our
    parent. Since the parameter here is of type Top, the method in Middle will be called and 4 will be printed.
    If bottom has a class which takes a Top parameter, this would have been called instead.

o2.m(o2) = 6
    Same as before, this time the parameter is of Type Middle and since the Bottom class has such method it will
    override the method in the Middle class and 6 will be printed.
