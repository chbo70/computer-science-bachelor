public and private are access modifiers, they control whether other classes can call a particular method or field.

private:
It is only used in a class or method itself. Therefore, it is only visible from the same method or class, also
classes and interfaces can't be private. The main usage is for the encapsulation, so that it hides the data from
everything outside the class or method.


public:
Variables, Classes and Methods which are declared as public can be accessed from everywhere. Which means that
we use public for top-level classes, interfaces and for the main. However, using to many public statements violates
the Object-Oriented Programming.


this:
Every object has a this-reference, with "this" the object can refer to itself. Due to "this" we can differ between local
variables and object-variables. "this" can also be returned.
